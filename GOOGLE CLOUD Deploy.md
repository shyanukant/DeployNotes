# Deploying a Django + React.js application on Google Cloud with a CI/CD pipeline involves several steps. 

### Step 1: Set up your project

Create a new project on the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com) if you haven't already.
Enable the necessary APIs: Cloud Build API, Cloud Run API, Cloud Storage API, and Cloud SQL Admin API.
Set up a Cloud SQL database (if required) for your Django application.
### Step 2: Set up your code repository

Create a Git repository for your project, either on a version control platform like GitHub or using Google Cloud Source Repositories.
Push your Django + React.js application code to the repository.
### Step 3: Set up Cloud Build

Create a cloudbuild.yaml file in the root directory of your project. This file defines the build steps and deployment process.
Configure the cloudbuild.yaml file to build and deploy your Django + React.js application. Below is an example configuration:
```yaml

  # Build React.js frontend
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm'
    args: ['install']
    dir: 'frontend'
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm'
    args: ['run', 'build']
    dir: 'frontend'

  # Build Django backend and collect static files
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/python'
    args: ['manage.py', 'collectstatic', '--noinput']
    dir: 'backend'

  # Build the Docker image
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args:
      - 'build'
      - '-t'
      - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/your-image-name'
      - '.'

  # Push the Docker image to Container Registry
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
    args:
      - 'push'
      - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/your-image-name'

  # Deploy to Cloud Run
  - name: 'gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk'
    entrypoint: 'gcloud'
    args:
      - 'run'
      - 'deploy'
      - 'your-service-name'
      - '--image'
      - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/your-image-name'
      - '--platform'
      - 'managed'
      - '--region'
      - 'us-central1'
      - '--allow-unauthenticated'
```
Make sure to replace 'frontend', 'backend', 'your-image-name', and 'your-service-name' with the appropriate values for your project.

### Step 4: Set up Cloud Run

Create a new service in Cloud Run by deploying your application using the Cloud Build configuration defined in cloudbuild.yaml.
Configure the necessary settings for your Cloud Run service, such as environment variables, container port, and memory allocation.
### Step 5: Set up Cloud Build triggers

Go to the Cloud Build section in the Cloud Console.
Create a new trigger that monitors your code repository for changes and triggers the build and deployment process automatically.
### Step 6: Configure the Django settings

Configure your Django settings to use the Cloud SQL database credentials.
Ensure you have the required dependencies in your Django requirements.txt file.
### Step 7: Run the CI/CD pipeline

Make changes to your code repository (e.g., push code changes, merge branches) to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
Monitor the build and deployment process in the Cloud Build logs.
Once the pipeline completes successfully, access your Django + React.js application at the Cloud Run service URL.
Please note that this is a high-level guide, and there may be additional steps or configurations specific to your project requirements. Make sure to adjust the instructions accordingly.

# Step 8: Set up environment variables

Identify any environment-specific configurations or sensitive information (such as API keys or database credentials) that your application requires.
Define these variables as environment variables in your CI/CD pipeline configuration or Cloud Run service settings.
Access these environment variables within your Django and React.js code as needed.
### Step 9: Configure static file serving

Determine the appropriate method for serving static files in your Django + React.js application.
Configure your Django settings to correctly serve static files from the appropriate location (either from the static build folder or through a CDN).
Ensure that your Cloud Run service correctly handles static file serving if applicable.
### Step 10: Set up a domain and SSL certificate (optional)

If you want to use a custom domain for your application, set up a domain name and configure DNS settings to point to your Cloud Run service.
Obtain an SSL certificate for your domain to enable HTTPS secure connections.
Configure the SSL certificate in the Cloud Run service settings.
### Step 11: Configure automated tests (optional)

Set up automated tests for your Django + React.js application to ensure that critical functionality works as expected.
Define test scripts or test suites for both the Django backend and the React.js frontend.
Incorporate these tests into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests as part of the deployment process.
### Step 12: Set up monitoring and logging

Configure monitoring and logging tools to gather insights into the performance and health of your deployed application.
Utilize tools like Google Cloud Monitoring, Google Cloud Logging, or third-party monitoring solutions to track metrics, errors, and logs.
These additional steps can help enhance your deployment process and ensure a more robust and reliable setup for your Django + React.js application on Google Cloud.

Remember to refer to the official Google Cloud documentation and consult the specific services' documentation for detailed instructions and best practices related to each step.

#### Happy deploying!
